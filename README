Timeout - a Bukkit plugin
=========================

timeout is a "kids time-out" plugin meant to keep your server
"peaceful". It teleports players that kill peaceful entities to
a "prison" or "time-out" location for a certain interval, and when
the punishment is over, teleports them to a "release" location.

The following mobs are considered "peaceful" for the purpose of
this plugin:
- pigs, sheep, cows, chickens
- villagers, iron golems, snowmans
- wolves, ocelots

Damaging friendly mobs is still permitted and the plugin doesn't
register it. You should probably create a jailbreak-proof holding
cell or prison, or a deserted island, or a metal cage suspended
above the fiery lava pits of the nether.

The timeout location and release location can be set by visiting
the location and typing /timeout and /release respectively. The
plugin stores the world so you can have a timeout location in
the nether and a release location in the normal world.

The plugins also has a timeout duration setting that defaults to
240 seconds. All settings can also be modified by editing the
config.yml file in the plugins folder.
