KidsTimeout - a Bukkit plugin
=========================

KidsTimeout is a "kids timeout" plugin meant to keep your server
"peaceful". It teleports players that kills peaceful entities to
a "prison" or "timeout" location for a certain interval, and when
the punishment is over, teleports them to a "release" location.

The following mobs are considered "peaceful" for the purpose of
this plugin:
- pigs, sheep, cows, chickens
- villagers, iron golems, snowmans
- wolves, ocelots
- mooshrooms

Damaging friendly mobs is still permitted and the plugin doesn't
register it. You should probably create a jailbreak-proof holding
cell or prison, or a deserted island, or a metal cage suspended
above the fiery lava pits of the nether.

The timeout location and release location can be set by visiting
the location and typing /timeout and /release respectively. The
plugin stores the world so you can have a timeout location in
the nether and a release location in the normal world. The
/timeoutlength option modifies the timeout length in seconds,
or shows it current value. The default timeout length is 240
seconds.

Players can also be put directly into timeout by passing the
username to the /timeout option: "/timeout adam".

Only players with the "kidstimeout" permission (or op by default
only) can change the settings or put another player in timeout.
Players with op privileges or with the "kidstimeout" permission
will never be put in a timeout.

The plugin attempts to prevent players from teleporting out of
the timeout location. This may interfere with other plugins
that can teleport - it's behavior is undefined because other
plugins can undo the restriction.
